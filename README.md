SkillLink WebApp
Project Description
The Job Web App is a platform designed to connect job seekers (especially skilled workers) with employers. The application allows:

Employers to post jobs and search for job seekers based on geolocation.
Job seekers to browse and filter job postings as well as update their profiles with their skills, location, and past work experience.
Both employers and job seekers can interact through a messaging system and schedule tasks using a calendar feature.
This application aims to simplify the hiring process, particularly for finding skilled workers such as electricians, plumbers, and other tradespeople.
